              RKM Foundation started at home — feeding the street animals on our lane, getting the
              hurt ones to a vet, and staying with them when they needed it. What we couldn&apos;t
              ignore slowly grew into a registered charitable trust.

            <h2 className="display-2 mt-5 text-center text-balance">It started with our dog, Tobler.</h2>
            <div className="mt-8 space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-ink/75">
              <p>
                Years ago, our pug Tobler fell ill, and we spent a few long nights beside him at a
                vet clinic. What we kept noticing wasn&apos;t the other patients — it was the people
                at the door. Strangers, mostly: they&apos;d found a dog or a cat hurt on the road and
                carried it in, not because it was theirs, but because they couldn&apos;t walk past it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some could afford the treatment. Many couldn&apos;t — and it&apos;s hard to forget
                someone who&apos;s done the kind thing and then can&apos;t do the next one. That stayed
                with us. By the time Tobler came home, one thing was clear: there&apos;s far more need
                out there than any one family can manage alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                We&apos;d been quietly feeding and treating animals on our own street for a while. After
                Tobler, in 2014, we made it official and registered RKM Foundation. For years we kept
                it simple — no campaigns, no big drives, just animals fed, wounds treated, and
                emergencies answered, paid for by our family and a few friends who pitched in.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-ink/75">
                We&apos;re honest about our size: RKM Foundation grew from a small, family-funded effort,
                and that&apos;s still close to who we are. What&apos;s changing is that we&apos;re starting to
                invite others in — to give, to volunteer, and to support trusted people already doing
                good work on the ground. We&apos;d rather grow slowly and keep every promise than grow
                fast and break one.
