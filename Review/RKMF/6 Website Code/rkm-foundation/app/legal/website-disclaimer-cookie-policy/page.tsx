            as payment processing, information sharing, or social media engagement. These
            websites are operated independently and are governed by their own policies and
            terms. RKM Foundation does not control or endorse their content, security practices,
            or privacy policies and is not responsible for them.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-ink/70">
            Donations and &quot;Shop for a Cause&quot; purchases support the charitable activities of
            RKM Foundation. While we strive to create meaningful impact, we do not guarantee
            specific outcomes, timelines, or results from any individual donation, fundraiser,
            or project.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-ink/70">
            Similarly, product purchases from the Shop for a Cause section support charitable
            initiatives but remain commercial product transactions and not charitable donations.
